# Best boys 
A repository-archive that stores the best boys on planet Earth!

![preview](./preview.png)

## Why?
As an Arch Linux user, I got tired of searching for the best boys with no single database!

In this repository, you can find pc/phone **wallpapers**, **avatars**, **memes**, or even clean **.png files** with transparent backgrounds.

*(I really hate scammy sites!)*

## Repository structure
```text
-- images
   |
   |-- <boy_name>
   |	  |
   |	  |-- wallpapers
   |	  |   |
   |	  |   |-- pc
   |	  |   |-- phone
   |	  |-- avatars
   |	  |-- transparent
   |	  |-- memes
   |	  |-- other
```

## How to download
As a fan of the best boys, I assume you already have a Linux distro installed *(Arch, NixOS, Void, Gentoo, ShefOS, Nyarch etc.).*

Just use `wget` to download!
